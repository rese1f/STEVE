async function collectBamboo(bot) {
    // The function is about collecting 10 bamboo plants. It equips the iron sword and uses the `exploreUntil` function to find 10 bamboo plants within a certain distance. If enough bamboo plants are found, it breaks them using the iron sword and collects the dropped bamboo items by moving to their location. If not enough bamboo plants are found, it returns an error message.
