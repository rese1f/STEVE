    // async function obtainTenWoodLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about obtaining 10 wood logs. It checks if there are already 10 wood logs in the inventory, and if so, returns. Otherwise, it calculates the number of logs needed and equips a wooden axe if available. It then uses `exploreUntil` to find a wood log if not found nearby, and mines the required number of wood logs using `mineBlock`. Finally, it reports the success of obtaining 10 wood logs.
