    // The function is about crafting a lightning rod. It first finds a suitable position to place the crafting table and places it there. Then it checks if there are enough copper ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines copper ores and smelts them into copper ingots. Finally, it crafts a lightning rod using the crafting table.
