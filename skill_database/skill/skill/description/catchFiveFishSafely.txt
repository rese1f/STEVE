    // async function catchFiveFishSafely(bot) {
    // The function is about catching five fish safely using a fishing rod. First, it checks if the bot has a fishing rod in its inventory. If not, it crafts one. Then, it finds a nearby water block and moves to a block adjacent to it. After looking at the water block, it equips the fishing rod and fishes in the water five times. If fishing is cancelled, it retries the same iteration.
