    // The function crafts a diamond sword using diamonds and sticks. It first checks if there are enough diamonds and sticks in the inventory. If there are not enough sticks, it crafts more using oak planks. Then, it places a crafting table near the player and uses it to craft a diamond sword. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the diamond sword has been crafted.
