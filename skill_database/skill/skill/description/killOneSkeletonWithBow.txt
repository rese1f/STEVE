    // async function killOneSkeletonWithBow(bot) {
    // The function is about killing a single skeleton using either a bow and arrow or a stone sword. First, it checks if the bot has a bow and arrows in the inventory. Then, it explores the environment until finding a skeleton within 32 blocks. If a skeleton is found, it equips either the bow or the stone sword and attacks the skeleton. If the bot has a bow and arrows, it attacks the skeleton from a distance. Otherwise, it attacks the skeleton with the stone sword.
