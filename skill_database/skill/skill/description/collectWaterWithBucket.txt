    // The function is about collecting water with a bucket. It first searches for a water block within a certain distance. If no water block is found, it explores the environment until it finds one. Once a water block is found, it equips the bucket in the hand, looks at the water block, and activates the item to collect water. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that water has been collected.
