async function mineThreeMoreOakLogs(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 3 oak logs. It first checks the initial inventory for oak logs. Then, it explores the environment until it finds 3 oak log blocks. If it cannot find enough oak logs, it returns. Otherwise, it mines the oak log blocks and compares the final inventory with the initial inventory to determine if it successfully mined 3 more oak logs.
