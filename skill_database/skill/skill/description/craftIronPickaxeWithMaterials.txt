    // The function crafts an iron pickaxe using 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks. If there are not enough iron ingots, it mines iron ores and smelts them into ingots. If there are not enough sticks, it crafts them. If there is no crafting table nearby, it places one. Finally, it crafts an iron pickaxe and logs the result.
