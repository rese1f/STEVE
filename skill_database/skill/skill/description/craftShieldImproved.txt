async function craftShieldImproved(bot) {
    // The function crafts a shield using oak planks and iron ingots. It checks if there are enough oak planks and iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it explores the environment to find and collect the required materials. It then places a crafting table near the bot and crafts a shield using the crafting table.
