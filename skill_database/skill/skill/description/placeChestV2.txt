    // The function is about placing a chest block in front of the bot. It checks if the chest block is available in the inventory. If it is, the bot places the chest block one block away from its current position. If the chest block is successfully placed, the bot sends a chat message indicating that the chest has been placed. If the chest block is not available in the inventory, the bot sends a chat message indicating that no chest was found.
